For the two-block parallel-aisle warehouse, except for adding a middle cross-aisle of size 1, the instances are identical to the single-block parallel-aisle warehouse instances.
For example, in a warehouse with 30 cells, the middle cross-aisle is between cells 15 and 16 and the distance between cells 15 and 16 is 2 (0.5 + 1 + 0.5 for leaving one aisle + crossing the cross-aisle + entering the other aisle).
